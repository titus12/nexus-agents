# go-modify-existing

Source: `.claude/rules/go-00-routing.md`
Stack: `go`

Entry skill: `$wf-go-mod`

Use for changes to existing Go features.


Codex execution notes:

- Do not spawn subagents unless the user explicitly asks for subagent / parallel / delegation; otherwise execute the named role strategy in the main thread.
- Before acting, load the referenced current rule/skill files by exact path and report which ones were loaded.
- Prefer precise search/codegraph before reading large files.
- End with concrete evidence: changed files, commands run, and verification result.

Workflow:

1. Locate the impact area with search or code graph.
2. Read the matching module skill when one exists.
3. Load `go-coding-rules.md`.
4. Use `go-hephaestus` for multi-file work and `go-quick` for narrow single-file work.
5. Check high-risk changes with `high-risk-api.md`.
6. Verify with build and relevant tests.

## Task Run Evidence Protocol

At the end of this workflow, submit a Task Run Evidence payload to Nexus instead of scoring the task inline. If the local API is unavailable, include the same JSON payload in the final response so the user can submit it later.

Endpoint:

```text
POST http://127.0.0.1:8766/api/task-runs
```

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "projectId": "<nexus project id or repo name>",
  "workflowTemplateId": "<workflow template id>",
  "workflowCopyId": "<project workflow copy id if known>",
  "workflowType": "<bugfix|code-review|research|refactor|feature-development|design|commit-gate|lark-integration|subagent-driven-development>",
  "taskTitle": "<short task title>",
  "submittedStatus": "<success|partial_success|failed|cancelled>",
  "startedAt": "<ISO-8601 if known>",
  "endedAt": "<ISO-8601 if known>",
  "durationMs": 0,
  "context": {
    "agent": "<primary agent>",
    "model": "<model id>",
    "rules": ["<rule ids loaded>"],
    "skills": ["<skill ids loaded>"],
    "tools": ["<tools used>"]
  },
  "metrics": {
    "turnCount": 0,
    "toolCallCount": 0,
    "testRunCount": 0,
    "retryCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 0,
    "filesChangedCount": 0
  },
  "evidence": {
    "summary": "<what was done>",
    "finalResult": "<delivered result>",
    "verification": {
      "hasVerification": true,
      "passed": true,
      "types": ["test", "build", "manual_check"],
      "commands": ["<commands run>"]
    },
    "unfinishedItems": [],
    "risks": [],
    "contextMissing": false
  }
}
```

Nexus will evaluate pending task runs asynchronously, produce attribution statistics for workflow / agent / model / rules / skills / context / tools, and index high-value learning cases with chromem-go for future retrieval.
